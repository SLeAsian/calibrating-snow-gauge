# 1. calibrating-snow-gauge

The gauge measures the snow density through a conversion of measurements of gamma ray emissions. Instrument wear and radioactive source decay may affect the functions used to convert the measured values into density readings over time. To adjust the conversion method, a calibration run is made each year at the beginning of the winter season. In this investigation, we developed a procedure to calibrate the snow gauge using log transformation and BCA.

# 2. combatting the human cytomegalovirus

When trying to locate the origin of replication, DNA is cut into segments and each segment is tested to determine whether it can replicate. If it does not replicate, then the origin of replication is not contained in the segment. This process can be very time consuming and expensive without leads on where to begin the search. In order to narrow the search and potentially reduce the amount of testing needed to find the origin of replication, we will conduct a statistical investigation of the DNA to identify unusually dense clusters of palindromes.

# 3. video games and lab design

Every year at UC Berkeley, 3,000-4,000 students enroll in Statistics courses, half of which take introductory statistics courses to satisfy the quantitative reasoning requirement. As an additional instruction resource, a committee of faculty and students have designed a series of computer labs intended to provide an alternative, interactive learning environment for statistics and probability. Since some have linked labs to video games, students in advanced statistics courses conducted a survey of undergraduate students enrolled in a lower-division statistics course regarding the extent to which the students play video games and which aspects of video games they find most and least fun. The responses will be used to provide insight to the designers as to what features in the computer lab would be the most attractive and beneficial to students.

# 4. the effect of maternal smoking on infant birth weight and health

While the association between birth weight and infant mortality is strong and well-established in the field of epidemiology, the cause of this relationship is unclear as it may be influenced by many confounding variables. We want to know if maternal smoking in particular leads to higher rates of infant mortality through its effects on birth weight. We will be using an enlarged portion of the CHDS dataset to determine if there is a meaningful difference between the birth weights of babies born to smokers and those born to non-smokers, as well as whether or not this difference has consequences for the health of the baby.
