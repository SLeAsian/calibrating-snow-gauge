# calibrating-snow-gauge
Contribution: Arthur Chang, Raya Kavosh, Siddharth Saha

The gauge measures the snow density through a conversion of measurements of gamma ray emissions. Instrument wear and radioactive source decay may affect the functions used to convert the measured values into density readings over time. To adjust the conversion method, a calibration run is made each year at the beginning of the winter season. In this investigation, we developed a procedure to calibrate the snow gauge using log transformation and BCA.
